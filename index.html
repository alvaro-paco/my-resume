<p>Dear recruiter.</p>

My name is Alvaro, I've 31 years old, I'm from São Carlos, city of Sao Paulo state. I was born and raised here, I studied all my childhood and college periods in the city as well. I come from a middle-class family and parents who have always prioritized their studies, so they made an extra effort so that they could have the best education possible.
completing high school, in 2008, I enrolled in the Mechanical Engineering course at Unesp, in the Ilha Solteira campus. I stayed there for 1 semester but, without a perspective of after graduated I will could work with airplanes mechanics, I gave up of the course. After a few months, I lost interest in the course because I did not have a perspective of working on something that really was going to make me professionally, besides the city itself does not please me very much, and I gave up.
<br /> After returning to Sao Carlos I went back to study, because I did not know for sure which career to pursue. It was then that I chose to study Computer Science. I have always had a lot of interest in the area, and I was already doing some freelance with website development and e-commerce. At the end of 2009 I was approved at USP (University of São Paulo), in the course of Bsc. Computer Science at the campus of São Carlos. I think it was the best option for me, because besides studying and working with something that really makes me happy I could be close to my family members during degree.
<br /> In 2010, I worked on some more projects for third parties and in 2011 I decided to start internships. I started working at a company called BrProg. They developed an e-commerce platform in PHP, based on the Opencart framework. I gained a lot of experience with e-commerce at this time. I worked there for a year there and by the end of 2012 they ended up closing. After that I continued working in another company called Async, they developed "open source" products such as Stoq, an ERP built entirely in Python 2. At Async I learned a lot about agile methodology, software development and management techniques . I worked a lot with unit tests as well. I stayed for a year working at Async and ended up getting a proposal to work at Coss Consulting. There was a friend of mine there who told me. Coss is a company that operates in the market developing solutions for integration of RFID technology in embedded systems and there I worked on several projects with Java, Groovy and Grails and Python. I stayed there for another year. After a year, I had a working routine as an effective developer but hired as an intern. After a conversation, they told me they would not "perform" untrained developers, even though I was performing tasks that qualified me for it. So I decided to go out and look for other places.
<br /> In the search for new opportunities I ended up doing two interviews, one at TokenLab and another at S2 IT. I was called shortly on S2 IT and, since I did not receive a return from Tokenlab, I ended up going to S2. But the company is located in Araraquara, a city 40 km away from São Carlos and it is a bit tiring to travel every day. So Tokenlab made a proposal a month later. As it was a more interesting proposal and was to work in person in São Carlos I ended up going to Tokenlab. I stayed there for 3 years.
<br /> In my trajectory at Tokenlab I gained a lot of experience with Software development and management. I have worked in several projects and with several technologies, among them are Android development, IOS development, Windows Phone, Web with JS frameworks as Angular and React, APIs and microservices with NodeJs, Groovy and Grails, deploy automation and continuous integration.
<br /> Over time, I was promoted twice, but the lack of prospect of growth made me seek new opportunities. It was then that I was approved in the selection process to work at Ditto Music, an English company that provides music distribution services. We provide customized services to independent artists. Today I am a development leader at Ditto. We have very satisfactory results and today we are migrating all operations from England to here. This is also a reflection of the experience I gained from other companies I worked with and the challenges I faced.
	On May 18, Ditto has change the CTO of the company and this new guy doesn’t like to work with remote teams and decided to close the BR office. So, I needed to move forward and accept a new challenge in BTG Pactual, at Sao Paulo, capital. I’ve started to work in the bank in the end of 2018. In BTG I’ve worked as principal developer with NodeJS, Angular, Docker, Kubernetes and awesome projects on financial investments market. Once at BTG, I’ve worked hard my done my best in the job. After 8 months I’ve got the knowledge of the business and the technologies of my job. But, I still working for the banking as a third-party employee without benefits and recognition that the internal employees had. So I decided to left the bank in the end of 2019 to assume a new role at Quero Education. I worked for Quero in a Software Engineering Manager, helping the company with complicated squads. Basically the company have some squads that's needs traction and performance. These aspects were affected by some internal conflicts and demotivated employees that’s causing unsafely environment of work. Applying personal development, engineering management techniques and agile oriented culture I try to help the company to extract the better results from the tech team.
<br /> What would make me accept another opportunity would be a prospect of growth in my career and projects that make sense for me and my professional moment. I’m passionate for technology, innovation, artificial intelligence and big data. I love to work for companies that have a huge positive impact in the society and help the people. I’ve from companies, excepting one or other, that have a strong collaborative and diversity culture. Of course compensation is important but it weighs more for me the quality of life that this new opportunity can provide me. You can find more information about my career and my work at my electronic address https://alvaropaco.github.io/my-resume/. I was also the target of a geek Hunter, a recruitment company and brings a very nice complementary vision: http://blog.geekhunter.com.br/diario-de-uma-mudanca-alvaro-paco-neto/.                                                                                               

                  <p> 
                    I`m planning to grow in my career studing new Software Engineering process and tecniques, new technologies like Artificial Inteligence, Crypto currency, Machine Learn and Cyber security. Also I want to have a leardship position in a technology team.
